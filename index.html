            <h2>National cuisine of Azerbaijan</h2>
            <p class="text1 ">Standing at the crossroads between Asia and Europe, Azerbaijan is rich in culinary delights that attract thousands of tourists each year.Azerbaijani cuisine (Azerbaijani: Azərbaycan mətbəxi) refers to the cooking styles and dishes of the Republic
                of Azerbaijan. The cuisine developed significantly due to its diversity of agriculture, from abundant grasslands which historically allowed for a culture of pastoralism to develop, as well as to the unique geographical location of Azerbaijan,
                which is situated on the crossroads of Europe and Asia with an access to the Caspian sea. Furthermore, the location, which was contended over by many historical kingdoms, khanates, and empires also meant that Azerbaijani cuisine was influenced
                by the culinary traditions of multiple different cultures, such as Turkic, Iranian, and Eastern European. As a result, Azerbaijani cuisine makes use of many different culinary techniques and ingredients. Blending elements from Turkish
                and Iranian cuisines, Azerbaijani dishes are known for their abundant use of seasonal vegetables and greens, including eggplant, tomatoes, peppers, beets, radishes and cabbage; and meats such as lamb, beef, and chicken.

            <p class="text2 ">One of the countrys best-known delicacies is black caviar, sought after worldwide and produced from sturgeon found in the Caspian Sea, which is just east of Azerbaijan and makes seafood an important part of Azerbaijani culinary identity. White
                sturgeon, Caspian salmon, sardines, grey mullet and a white fish called kutum are all popular amongst seafood lovers.
            </p>
            <p class="text3 ">Azerbaijanis take a lot of pride in their food and sense of hospitality, which is usually accompanied by a glass of hot black tea, considered the national beverage. Two-day culinary tours to picturesque regions, like Gabala and Sheki located
                in the north, are popular with foodies who plan their vacations around exploring new gastronomic experiences
